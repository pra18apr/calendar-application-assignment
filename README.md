The acceptance criteria was: WHEN I open the planner, I scroll down, I view the timeblocks for that day, I click into a timeblock, I click the save button for that timeblock, I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist.

## JS examples

This function allows me to save to local storage whatever is written in the rows by clicking the button:

Below function allows the color of the rows to change according to the time of day, -2 allows me to target only the last 2 characters of the hour id(the numbers in this case)
